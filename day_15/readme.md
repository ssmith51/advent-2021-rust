# Advent Day 15: Extended Polymerization
You've almost reached the exit of the cave, but the walls are getting closer together. Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in chitons, and it would be best not to bump any of them.

The cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of risk level throughout the cave.

## Puzzle 2

## Summary
Solution 1 was pretty easy and straightforward, the second one required a complete re-write. That took me quite a while to figure out and required a whiteboard.
